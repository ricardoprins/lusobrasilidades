I am using Jinja2 + FastAPI. The initial idea was to learn how to use FastAPI, but I ended up enjoying it more than I thought, so I've decided to use it.

Why Jinja2? Well, it's simple: this is a small website, it won't have many requirements, so I didn't want to use anything unnecessarily complex here.
